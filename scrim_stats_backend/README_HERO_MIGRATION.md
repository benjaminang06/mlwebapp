# Hero Model Migration Reference Guide

## Overview

This document outlines the process of migrating from string-based hero fields to proper foreign key relationships in the Esports Management App. The migration was completed successfully and all hero references are now properly established.

## Changes Made

1. **Database Schema Changes**:
   - Added `hero_played_id` column to the `api_playermatchstat` table
   - Added `hero_id` column to the `api_draftinfo` table
   - Updated the existing data to correctly link hero names to hero IDs

2. **Model Changes**:
   - Updated `PlayerMatchStat.hero_played` to use a ForeignKey relationship
   - Updated `DraftInfo.hero` to use a ForeignKey relationship
   - Specified the proper column names using `db_column` parameter

3. **Admin Interface Changes**:
   - Updated admin search fields to use `hero_played__name` instead of `hero_played`
   - Updated admin search fields to use `hero__name` instead of `hero`
   - Implemented proper `autocomplete_fields` for better admin UX

## Database Status

After migration, the database status is:

- PlayerMatchStat records: 10
- DraftInfo records: 0
- PlayerMatchStat records with hero relationships: 10
- DraftInfo records with hero relationships: 0

## Benefits of the Migration

1. **Data Integrity**: Foreign key constraints ensure that only valid heroes can be referenced
2. **Performance**: Direct ID references are faster than string lookups
3. **Features**: Enables filtering, searching, and sorting by hero properties
4. **Admin UX**: Autocomplete fields make data entry easier and more accurate

## Future Considerations

When adding new heroes, simply add them to the `Hero` model, and they will be available for selection in both the `PlayerMatchStat` and `DraftInfo` forms.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues:

1. Check that the hero exists in the database
2. Verify that column names match between models and database tables
3. Run migrations with `--fake` if needed to resolve migration state issues

## Database Fix Process

The migration required direct database manipulation to preserve existing data. We:

1. Created backup of the original database
2. Added new foreign key columns to tables
3. Populated the foreign key columns with appropriate hero IDs
4. Updated the Django models to reference these columns
5. Applied migrations to make these changes official

All these steps were completed successfully with no data loss.
